# CO2 emissions per capita and climate change vulnerability
Visualization created using Stata that displays how countries with the highest vulnerability to climage change have the lowest CO2 emissions. <br/>
<br/>
The visualization is an attempt to replicate the process of visualizing already created visual. Result varies possibly due to year chosen for visualizing. <br/>
<br/>
I make use of 2020 data and instead of World Bank data on CO2 emissions per capita, I opt for 'Our World in Data'.
